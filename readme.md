If you want to play with the code (and you're not a git user) click on the green button and download it via a zip. 

[Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

[Install Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) either from the plugins within Visual Studio Code, or just click the link. This is necessary to run the website, it must be run from within a server as the webcam is needed and that requires a little more special sauce than some websites :).

Once you have downloaded the code, Visual Studio and installed Live Server just drag the folder containing the code onto the Visual Studio icon. Then in the bottom right corner of Visual Studio you should see _Go Live_, click on that and a browser window should open running the website.
